SecureScrolls UI
Project Overview

For my MSc. Computer Science we were tasked with implementing an alogorithm of our choice and using it to encrypt files. This is the UI of that project. The API can be found at https://github.com/Yoofi-A-Appiah/RC4-Encryptor. SecureScrolls UI is the front-end interface for the SecureScrolls file encryption application. It provides users with a simple and intuitive interface to encrypt and decrypt files using the RC4 algorithm.
